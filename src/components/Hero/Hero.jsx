          <p className="text-muted">
            My name is Summer Sheridan-Zabre, a licensed clinical social worker. My approach to psychotherapy is to focus on relationship building and fun. I started my career after graduating from Syracuse University with a major in Social Work and a minor in Psychology. Shortly after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, I relocated to New York City and began working for the American Red Cross September 11 Recovery Program. I then went on to attain my masters in social work from Fordham University with a specialization in children and families. It was my experience in graduate school interning in a therapeutic nursery that I found my passion for social work in educational settings. I spent over 10 years working as a school social worker. I provide a warm and supportive environment where I help children and families address issues that include: managing emotions that impede growth and development, developing social skills, building a positive sense of self, and increasing the capacity for strong communication skills. My approach is rooted in relationship building. I focus on understanding what clients expected outcomes are and know that every family is unique. Through the therapeutic relationship I aim to empower my clients and families to learn and grow together.
